#
# Why not apt: ldc is currently missing from Debian Testing during a
# transition (was in stable/trixie and unstable/sid, but not testing/forky).
# Same class of issue as the GtkD-from-source fix in #49. The upstream
# tarball install is version-pinned and distro-independent, so a future
# apt-archive disruption does not break the CI.
#
# Pinned to 1.40.0 to match what Debian Stable (trixie) ships, so the
# Stable and Testing CI builds are not silently testing different
# compiler versions.
